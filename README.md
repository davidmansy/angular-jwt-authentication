AngularJS Authentication with JWT

Here is the code I wrote following the egghead.io training serie about angularJS authentication with JWT.
https://egghead.io/series/angularjs-authentication-with-jwt

Here is the egghead.io serie description
JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are a more modern approach to authentication.As the web moves to a greater separation between the client and server, JWT provides a terrific alternative to traditional cookie based authentication models. For more information on JWT visit http://jwt.io/

In this series, we’ll be building a simple application to get random user information from a node server with an Angular client. We’ll then implement JWT to protect the random user resource on the server and then work through the frontend to get JWT authentication working.

By the end, we’ll have an application which has a single username/password combination (for simplicity) and uses tokens to authorize the client to see the random user information. You’ll be able to login, get random users, and logout.
